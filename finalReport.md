# Final Project

The final project is to ask a database related question and give an implementation, answer and exposition. The final assignment is carried out in groups in stages.

# STAGES

## STAGE 1 : Initial Version: a Final Project Plan

In the initial submission, you need to elaborate on the following issues
1. Descrobe the problem you propose related to database topic in about 200-300 words
2. How you are going to solve the problem and describe how you are going to achieve your solution
3. Justify your approach, giving a practical example to illustrate it
4. What kind of articles you have read or are going to read to get your problem and solution

The topic of your final project is not limited to the presentation topic you give in the class

### Hand-in

The initial version should be handed in to TA via email zeming_liu@brown.com and cc sbz@cs.brown.edu, due at Mar 13 11:00 AM. Please include the group and group number you are in. You can check the group in the groups page.

## STAGE 2: Design Sharing and Reviews

In this stage, each group will present their proposed project topic and its database design using a flowchart. We will simulate a design review in a tech company and you are the designers and reviewers. The presentation should be approximately 15-20 minutes in length, and should cover the following aspects:

Overview of the project topic: Briefly introduce the topic and its relevance to the field of database design.

Description of the data: Explain the data that will be used in the project, including the source and structure of the data.

Data modeling: Describe the process of designing the database schema and data model, including entity-relationship diagrams and other relevant modeling techniques.

Flowchart: Present the project's database design using a flowchart, illustrating the data flow and interactions between different entities.

Feedback and suggestions: Each group in the class should provide feedback and suggestions for improvement for at least one design from other groups, based on their own knowledge of database design and related fields.

Here is a simple example of a flowchart:

### Expectations:

Quality of the database design: The design should be well-structured and clearly presented using a diagram of your model.

Relevance to the field of database design: The project topic should be relevant to the course content and demonstrate your understanding of the concepts learned.

Feedback and collaboration: Students should actively participate in the feedback and collaboration process, providing constructive feedback to their peers and incorporating feedback received into their own work.

Good luck with the second phase of your project!


## STAGE 3 : Final Paper

The final paper serves as a comprehensive research plan for your project. It should be concise yet thorough with 2-3 pages, presenting a culmination of your previous work. The paper should include the following sections, organized in a formal manner:

    1. Title and Introduction
    2. Research Objectives
    3. Literature Review

    This three part should have already been covered in your Stage 1 submission and try to organize them in a more formal way.

    4. Methodology
    5. Expected Results
    6. Data Collections

    This three part should have been covered in your Stage 2 presentation and try to organize them in a more formal way. Please do not forget to include the graph you made in your presentation and illustrate them.

    7. References
    8. Contribution of the team members in the each stage of the project

### Hand-in
    * Please submit your final paper via email to TA zeming_liu@brown.edu, with a copy to Professor Stan sbz@cs.brown.edu, before May 19 at 11:00 AM.
    * Ensure you include your group name and group number in the submission.
    * You can verify your group details on the groups page, as this will be considered when assessing your class participation and final paper.
