This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, just click "[use this template]"!

Prof. Zdonik. We'll be sending them out all at once.

## What this class is about

<!-- <img alt="Microservices" src="assets/deathstar.png" height=350> -->

Modern software systems are complex and are frequently broken into many component microservices.
Managing these microservices requires visibility into the system state using massive amounts of
data generated by the system reflecting its state. When some symptom of an issue occurs like
some slow down in response time, engineers would look through these data to get alerted of the
symptom, identify the root cause, and resolve the issue. This process of observing and managing
system state is called Observability.

Observability is fundamentally a data management problem: how to generate, collect, ingest, store,
and query vast amounts of heterogeneous data. As an example, the table below shows that on any given day, Slack maintains more than a petabyte of data and  generates nearly half a petabyte per day.
