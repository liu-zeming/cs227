## What this class is about

<!-- <img alt="Microservices" src="assets/deathstar.png" height=350> -->

Modern software systems are complex and are frequently broken into many component microservices.
Managing these microservices requires visibility into the system state using massive amounts of
data generated by the system reflecting its state. When some symptom of an issue occurs like
some slow down in response time, engineers would look through these data to get alerted of the
symptom, identify the root cause, and resolve the issue. This process of observing and managing
system state is called Observability.

Observability is fundamentally a data management problem: how to generate, collect, ingest, store,
and query vast amounts of heterogeneous data. As an example, the table below shows that on any given day, Slack maintains more than a petabyte of data and  generates nearly half a petabyte per day.
